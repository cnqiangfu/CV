I am now a final year of the Ph.D. with the National Engineering Laboratory for Robot Visual Perception and Control Technology at Hunan University, directed by Prof. Hongshan Yu. Prior to beginning the Ph.D program, I obtained my B.S. degrees with a Top 5% GPA in Electronic Information Science and Technology from Hunan Normal University, 2015. Subsequently, I was recommended for admission to be a postgraduate at Hunan Univerisity without exams. From 2019 to 2020, I was a Visiting Scholar in the Robotic and Vision Group, Department of Computing Science, University of Alberta (Canada), under the supervision of Prof. Hong Zhang (IEEE and CAE Fellow). 

May major research interests include mobile robot, visual SLAM, computer vision (CV). Currently, I am looking for an openning job about SLAM or CV, such as postdoctor, research associate position, or algorithm engineer. I can be reached at: cn.fq@qq.com.
